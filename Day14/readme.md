❓🤔 Why use Taints and Tolerations when we can manually schedule pods using nodeName?
❓🤔 Why use NodeSelector and labels when we have Taints and Tolerations?
❓🤔 Which method is used in real-time?

Let's understand the concept of Taints and Tolerations as part of our CKA series:

🔹 𝐓𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭 🚧🚫: Setting up Fences
